# Simple Keylogger Project

## Overview
This project is a **simple keylogger** developed as part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**. The keylogger is designed to capture and log keystrokes on a system in a text file for analysis, with an emphasis on ethical usage and security considerations.

### Key Features:
- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures both printable and special keys (e.g., space, enter).
- **Timestamped Logs**: Each keystroke is logged with a timestamp for tracking purposes.
- **Stop Condition**: The program halts and saves the log when the `ESC` key is pressed.
- **Log File**: All captured keystrokes are saved in `key_log.txt` for later review.

## Ethical Use Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Keyloggers can be dangerous if misused, and their deployment without the proper consent is illegal in many jurisdictions. Always ensure you have proper permissions before using such tools.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- **Python 3.x** must be installed on your system.
- Install the required library `pynput` by running:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

### Running the Keylogger:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/keylogger-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd keylogger-project
```

3. Run the `keylogger.py` script:

```bash
python keylogger.py
```

4. The keylogger will now run in the background and record keystrokes to `key_log.txt`. Press `ESC` to stop the program and save the log file.

## File Structure:
- `keylogger.py` - The main Python script that runs the keylogger.
- `key_log.txt` - The output file that stores logged keystrokes.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Log Encryption**: Encrypting the log file to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Cloud Logging**: Sending keystroke logs to a secure server for remote monitoring.
- **Enhanced Security**: Adding detection mechanisms to alert users of unauthorized keylogging.
